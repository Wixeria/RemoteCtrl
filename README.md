# RemoteCtrl
“I built this to feel in control again.”

A web-based + Discord command bot for remote PC access.
Minimal, personal, and dead simple — just like the feeling I was chasing when I made it.

Use it, fork it, build on it.
This one’s for anyone who ever felt like they had nothing but time, pain, and an idea. 

# Features
- Remote system control via Discord     messages or web UI
 
-	Run terminal commands
 
-	Restart, shutdown, get system info, and more
 
-	Simple and fast Node.js backend

# Setup
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Create a .env file in the root with the following:
   ```env
   TOKEN = your_bot_token
   OWNER_ID = your_discord_id
   WEB_SECRET = your_web_secret
   ```
4. Fill in .env file.
5. Start the bot with `node .`
6. (Optional) You can start the bot whenever your machine turn on by just following these steps:
   - Create shortcut of start.bat
   - Copy shortcut.
   - Press Win + R
   - Type: `shell:startup`
   - Paste it into Startup folder."

# Note
This wasn’t made for attention.
It was made because I needed something to hold onto.
It’s not perfect. But it works.
Keep it safe. Keep it local. You know what this is.

# Last thing
Yes, you can reverse engineer it if you want.
Study it, break it, rebuild it — doesn’t matter.
But whatever you do with it,
I won’t take responsibility for the outcome.

This was mine for a moment.
Now it’s yours, if you want it.
